## INSTALLATION

**1.,** All AwesomeChat files located in *chat* directory. Vendor files located in *vendor* directory and external Frameworks in *framework* directory. Some resource files can be found in *resources* directory. Simply add *chat*, *resources*, *vendor* and *framework* directories to your project.

**2.,** You need the following iOS (built in) libraries: UIKit.framework, CoreGraphics.framework, Foundation.framework, SystemConfiguration.framework, Security.framework, CFNetwork.framework, Accounts.framework, Social.framework, libicucore.dylib, libc++.dylib.

To add libraries follow these steps: Click on the Targets → Your app name → and then the 'Build Phases' tab and then expand 'Link Binary With Libraries'. Click the plus button in the bottom left of the 'Link Binary With Libraries' section and choose library items from the list.

**3.,** You also need the latest Firebase.framework and FirebaseSimpleLogin.framework (already included). But if you need, you can download from here:

https://cdn.firebase.com/ObjC/Firebase.framework-LATEST.zip<br>
https://cdn.firebase.com/ios/FirebaseSimpleLogin.framework-LATEST.zip<br>

To add Firebase.framework and FirebaseSimpleLogin.framework, just unzip the above files and drag the .framework folders into your Xcode project under 'Frameworks'.

**4.,** Firebase makes use of Objective-C classes and categories, so you'll need to add '-ObjC' under 'Other Linker Flags' in 'Build Settings'. 

**5.,** Firebase currently does not support arm64. So you should choose 'Standard architectures (armv6, armv7s)' at 'Architectures' in 'Build Settings'.

**6.,** The *Prefix.pch* should contain:

```
#import <UIKit/UIKit.h>
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <SystemConfiguration/SystemConfiguration.h>
```

**7.,** You also need several external libraries which are included. But if you need, you can download them from here:

https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking<br>
https://github.com/jessesquires/MessagesTableViewController<br>
https://github.com/jessesquires/JSQSystemSoundPlayer<br>
https://github.com/relatedcode/ProgressHUD<br>

To use this libraries, just add AFNetworking, JSMessagesViewController, JSQSystemSoundPlayer and ProgressHUD directories to your project.

**8.,** You need to use your own Firebase account. To get your Firebase account click here:

https://www.firebase.com/signup

**9.,** Replace existing Firebase account in *common.h*:

```
#define FIREBASE @"https://relatedchat.firebaseio.com"
```

**10.,** You need to register you app at Facebook and Twitter.

https://developers.facebook.com/apps<br>
https://dev.twitter.com/apps<br>

**11.,** At Facebook you need to enter your apps bundle identifier (Twitter does not require that).
